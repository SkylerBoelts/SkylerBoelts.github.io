	Hi there! My name is Skyler Boelts and I am a Gameplay Programmer living in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. This April I will be graduating from DigiPen: Institute of Technology with a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Game Design.

	My current project is Eidolon: Fate of Fools, a networked arena shooter with a card game twist. Astral combatants use abilities inspired by major arcana tarot cards. It is in development but stay tuned as it will be releasing this summer! 
	
    So far I have released 2 games to Steam. My first released game was Inline: Out of Time, a 2D speedrunning platformer where you deliver/throw packages as a rollerskating delivery person. It has a great aesthetic and soundtrack. The more recent release is Cats ‘N Critters, a “Diablo-Like” couch co-op game about wizard cats defeating a dragon to get back their ball of yarn. It has a cute, toy-like aesthetic evoking tabletop minis. 
	
    When I’m not making games, I’m playing them. I am currently working through my New Year’s resolution of finishing 25 new games outside of my comfort zone. I also spend a lot of time playing boardgames, tabletop games, and card games (especially Magic: the Gathering).
	
    Most importantly, I have a cat named Kiki. She’s a cute, chatty black cat who spends most of her time lounging or riding around on my shoulders.
